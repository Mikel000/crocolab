				This website was created by four students as part of a three weeks university project called CITIES, aiming at making cities more sustainable. Our idea was to focus on single use labware that could be replaced by glass or simply be reused, this project was both carried out in our own wet lab in LPI where we wanted to reach the goal of changing 15% of single use plastic labware. At the same time, this website was done with the goal of gathering useful information and solutions to actually make a transition in your lab. The idea of our browser was to make it easier for researchers to have information about their own equipment : if it is autoclavable ( so re-usable) and if it is recyclable or not.

				If you have any questions or suggestions you can contact us in the contact section.
