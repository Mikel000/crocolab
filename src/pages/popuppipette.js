            <h3>Time</h3> 
            12- 24 hours passively (collecting, baking or autoclaving), active time depends on the number of items;   
            <h3>Reagents and equipment</h3> 
            pipette cleaner, pipette holder, connection to the tap water, bleach, ALCO TABS or detergent you use for liquid biologically contaminated waste, autoclave and autoclavable bags;
           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Put the pipette holder in the lab to collect the pipettes throughout the day ( adjust the span to the volumes of the lab) </li>
            <li>Work over a sink area and wear large rubber gloves to protect yourself from any unknown contamination!</li>
            <li>For washing, remove the pipettes from the pipette holders. Let the water drain from the pipettes. </li>
            <li>Place as many pipettes as can fit into the basket of the cleaner. Put the pipette basket inside the housing of the pipette washer. </li>
            <li>Drop two ALCO TABS into the bottom of the pipette-housing unit. Connect the small diameter tube attached to the pipette washer to the flexible tygon tubing on the tap water.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the large diameter flexible tube will drain the water into the sink. Turn on the hot water and set flow rate to 2 liters per minute. Run it at this flow rate for several cycles. The ALCO TABS will dissolve during these first few cycles washing the pipettes. </li>
            <li>After washing, fill the pipette holders with dIH2O. Squirt a little detergent and a splash of bleach into the container and swirl with a pipette. (Glass pipettes should be fully immersed in the pipette holders, otherwise the crud dries onto them making them much more difficult to wash.) </li>
            <li>Autoclave the pipettes in an autoclavable bag  with the regular for your lab conditions for glass. </li>
            <li>You can also bake the pipettes with 220 degrees overnight, that sterilizes and destroys RNases.</li>
             
           </ul>
            Open the bag under the hood for further usage to maintain sterility.
