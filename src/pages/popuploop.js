            <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Pass the loop at an angle through the flame of a gas burner, or place it into the microincinerator until the entire length of the wire becomes orange from the heat.</li>
            <li>Allow the loop to cool a few seconds before contacting the inoculum to avoid killing the microorganisms.</li>
          
           </ul>

           In this way all contaminants on the wire are incinerated. 
            Never lay the loop down once it is sterilized, or it may again become contaminated. Keep them in a sterile bag if not used.
