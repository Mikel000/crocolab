				The MASH alarm. This DIY fume hood alarm developed by students and staff at MIT starts to beep if motion is not detected for three minutes at a hood where the sash has been left too far open. An open fume hood consumes as much energy as 3.5 single-family homes in the same period of time.4 The MASH alarm saved MIT 3,500 kWh per year, which is equivalent to 3 metric tons of CO2 and $500 per hood!5 If you're interested in building your own MASH alarms, you can find more information here.
				Avoid doing small orders, try to have plannings and inventory to know what your needs are in the near future, also you won’t have to ask for a faster delivery which consumes more.


				Buy eco-friendly racks or racks in a 384 tip format instead of a 96 tip format


				reduce consumables and energy:
				create the protocols of recycling and reusing the labware to control the flow of consumables. The protocols and/or database should be specific for a particular lab and contain updates on criteria and safety standards.
				analyze the amount of wastes and needs: is it possible to order less or substitute some supplies with glass/reusable plastic
				order the 70 degrees freezer instead of 80
				check if it possible

				managing laboratories as system:
				use the management between the labs of the institute: spreading awareness and ideas will help reduce the amount of waste
				create or use existing calculators to compute the budget, energy consumption and savings


				educating and informing the staff:
				talk about the sustainability during the lab meetings
				run test or demonstrate the sterility of the lab ware to maxima the trust of the employees
				spread the existing guides to have more ideas applicable in the particular laboratory
