            <h3>Time</h3> 
            passive time consumption about 24 hours, active time depends on the amount of dishes (5-7 minutes per 10 items of 100mm diameter) 
            <h3>Reagents and equipment</h3> 
            Bleach, ALCO TABS or detergent you use for liquid biologically contaminated waste, spatula, big box with a cover, autoclave and dishwasher 
           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Put an empty big plastic box near the sink, or other open space free area in the lab to gather the dishes during the day. The box should be empty throughout the day because thus we can control the amount of chlorine in the bleach.</li>
            <li>Put the dishes used into a box and close the cover. Open each dish before putting inside. If the culture is in the liquid media, trash it first into the liquid waste bottle, if it is solid, place the dish with the agar and culture directly to the box</li>
            <li>At the end of the day pour the bleach into the box to cover the dishes at least 5 cm above and let it rest for a night</li>
            <li>Use the spatula to scrape the agar out of the dishes. Work over a sink area and wear large rubber gloves to protect yourself from any unknown contamination.</li>
            <li>Wash the dishes in the dishwasher and then autoclave in the regular for your lab conditions for glass.</li>
